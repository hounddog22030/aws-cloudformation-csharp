# VisualStudio Cookbook
This Chef cookbook installs Visual Studio 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015 from an ISO.

# Requirements

This cookbook assumes the appropriate version of the .NET framework has already been installed before running the VisualStudio cookbook. To install .NET you can use the [dotnetframework cookbook](https://github.com/daptiv/dotnetframework). You must reboot the system after the .NET installation and before the VisualStudio installation.

- VisualStudio 2010, 2012, and 2013 require .NET 4.5.x.
- VisualStudio 2015 requires .NET 4.6.

This cookbook requires 7-zip to be installed so it can extract the ISO. To ensure this happens this cookbook includes the [seven_zip](https://github.com/daptiv/seven_zip) default recipe.

NOTE - This cookbook cannot be installed over naked WinRM, i.e. knife-winrm or test-kitchen. This cookbook will work over WinRM via Vagrant and Packer because they both wrap Chef executions in a scheduled task.

### VS 2012 on Windows Server 2008 SP1 and Windows 7
For Windows7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 SP1 you must first install [KB2664825](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2664825), otherwise the VS installer will reboot in the middle of the installation. See [Save yourself from insanity: Visual Studio 2012 silent install](https://gshaw0.wordpress.com/2013/09/06/save-yourself-from-insanity-visual-studio-2012-silent-install/) for more details. To avoid this it is recommended that you first install [SQL CE 4](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17876). You can install SQL CE 4 via Chef using the [sqlce cookbook](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/sqlce).

# Usage

Set the `node['visualstudio']['source']` attribute to the download location of the VisualStudio ISO, for example: http://example.com/installs. Then add `'visualstudio::default'` to your runlist. The same source attribute is used for all editions, versions, and updates.

By default this cookbook assumes you're installing VisualStudio 2012 Ultimate. If you'd like to install another edition set the 'edition' attribute to: 'community', 'professional', 'premium', or 'testprofessional'. If you'd like to install a different version set the 'version' attribute to: '2010', '2012', '2013', '2015'.

If you need to install multiple different versions/editions of VisualStudio on the same node you must instead set the 'installs' attribute. If the installs attribute is set then the version and edition attributes are ignored.

```ruby
node['visualstudio']['installs'] = [{
  'version' => '2015',
  'edition' => 'professional'
}, {
  'version' => '2013',
  'edition' => 'testprofessional'
}]
```

Each VS version/edition pair has their own unique attributes which can be overridden. The most common to override would be `checksum` and `filename`. For example, we can override the VS 2013 Professional checksum and filename attributes like so:

```ruby
node.override['visualstudio']['2013']['professional']['checksum'] = 'c4930bb83454a2fcbc762da79a4227e92fdbef7d0b395c619829a36c3fb4ec54'
node.override['visualstudio']['2013']['professional']['filename'] = 'My_vs2013.iso'
```

Unlike newer versions of VisualStudio which use an AdminDeployment.xml file, VS 2010 uses an unattend.ini file. This cookbook includes a working default unattend.ini template which you may optionally override. The use of a template instead of a static file is required due to relative paths inside the file.

# Recipes

## default
Ensures all VisualStudio prereqs are installed first and then only runs the install recipe if they are met. You should add this recipe to your run list.

## install
Installs VisualStudio using the included AdminDeployment.xml or unattend.ini. Included by the default recipe.

## nuget
Configures the enable_nuget_package_restore environment variable. Included by the default recipe.

## dotnet_prereq
Logs a warning if .NET 4.5.x is not installed. This recipe does not curently check for .NET 4.6. Included by the default recipe.

# Optional Recipes

## install_update
Installs VS updates from the corresponding VS update ISO that is publicly downloadable from Microsoft. Add this to your runlist to update all versions of VS in your installs attribute array. By default you must place the iso in the same folder as the main VS ISO since they all share the same source attribute.

## install_vsto
Installs the Microsoft Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio 2012. Add this to your runlist if you need Office development tools for Office plugin development. Other versions of VS are not currently supported and will log a Chef warning.

# Resource/Provider

This cookbook makes the `visualstudio_edition` and `visualstudio_update` resource definitions available.

For example, to install Visual Studio 2010 using the `visualstudio_edition` definition:

```ruby
visualstudio_edition 'vs_2015_professional' do
  edition: 'professional',
  version: '2015',
  install_dir: 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0',
  source: 'http://localhost:8080/en_visual_studio_professional_2015_x86_x64_dvd_6846629.iso',
  package_name: 'Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2015',
  checksum: '8d6d9a13ccb7f409161518e07e610c12180f415995fa417fa1343a4f2f4ce74b',
  installer_file: 'vs_professional.exe'
end
```

# Troubleshooting

If the installer fails very early in the install process, check a few of things:

- Ensure you have the correct .NET version installed first and you've rebooted.
- Check the VS installation log which is located in c:\program files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio &lt;version&gt;\vsinstall.log
- Ensure you're not running over naked WinRM, i.e. knife-winrm or test-kitchen. Unfortunately because of the Windows security model this cookbook will not work over WinRM without a scheduled task.

# TO DO

- Support all VS 2010 editions
- Support all VS 2015 editions
- Check for .NET 4.6 installed, but only if VS 2015 is going to be installed
- Support VSTO on all versions of VS
- More tests
- Refactor duplication between cookbook helper and test helper
